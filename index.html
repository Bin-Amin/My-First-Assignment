            <p>That company hired computer programmers every now and then and when the job recommendation came through,
                Alvaro knew nothing about programming. He hadnt gone to college or university to study it or anything
                related to computers, but he did have a love for them and could use them independently.</p>

            <p>Hollywood movies have made it seem like all coders can hack and break into systems, well that not
                entirely true. The cornerstone of a coder also known as a programmer or software developer is creating
                software for various applications. </p>

            <p>Alvaro Videla comes from a very humble background with his wife being the main source of income, which
                was less than their expenses, $1 920 per year. He tells his story that he started selling some food
                items door-to-door to make ends meet, but he still couldnt make enough and had to settle for $20 a
                week, excluding expenses. </p><br>

            <p>All of this happened while they were living at his wife s aunt, where they constantly felt like their

                introduced programming to him. He told Alvaro that there are many job opportunities in the cities and
                told him about a company called Live Interactive.</p>
